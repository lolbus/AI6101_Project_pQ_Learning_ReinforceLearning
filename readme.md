In this assignment, students must code and implement one of the reinforcement learning algorithms taught in the class. The algorithm will be used to develop a player bot that could optimally push the box into the end goal without falling into the cliff within a 2D cartesian plane. Students could also modify or redesign the algorithms for bonus marks. For my work, I developed a custom Q-Learning algorithm called pQ-Learning which could learn the optimal movement faster than the original q-Learning, with lesser iteration loops relative to the original Q-Learning. This is done by remembering a predefined X historical movement rather than just the last movement and update the weighs of the X historical movement after each move rather than just the last move
