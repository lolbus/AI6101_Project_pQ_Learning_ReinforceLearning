# AI6101 Introduction to AI and AI Ethics Assignment 1

In this assignment, students must code and implement one of the reinforcement learning algorithms taught in the class. The algorithm will be used to develop an Agent that could optimally push the box into the end goal without falling into the cliff. All events occur within a 2D cartesian plane. Students could also modify or redesign the algorithms for bonus marks. For my work, I developed a custom Q-Learning algorithm called pQ-Learning which could learn the optimal movement faster than the original q-Learning, with lesser iteration loops relative to the original Q-Learning. This is done by remembering a predefined X historical movement rather than just the last movement and update the weighs of the X historical movement after each move rather than just the last move

Only for the reference of curious people, eager to learn something new.
