In this assignment, students must code and implement one of the reinforcement learning algorithms taught in the class. The algorithm will be used to develop a player bot that could optimally push the box into the end goal without falling into the cliff within a 2D cartesian plane. Students could also modify or redesign the algorithms. For my work, I developed a custom Q-Learning algorithm called pQ-Learning which could learn the optimal movement faster than the original q-Learning, within lesser iteration loops.  

Only for the reference of curious people, eager to learn something new.  

Please check the plagiarism rules. I do not support any misuse of the source code. 
Final Grade: A
