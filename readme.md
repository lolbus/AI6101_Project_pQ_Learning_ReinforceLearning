In this assignment, students must code and implement one of the reinforcement learning algorithms taught in the class to develop a player bot that could optimally push the box into the end goal without falling into the cliff. Students could also modify or redesign the algorithms. For my work, I developed a custom Q-Learning algorithm called pQ-Learning which could learn the optimal movement faster than the original q-Learning, within lesser iteration loops.
